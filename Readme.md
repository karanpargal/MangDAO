# üí° **What we solve**

GateBounty is a platform that DAOs can use to incentivize their loyal members by providing them with exclusive opportunities.
This provides them with a better community and helps them in making their submissions quality based rather than quantity.
- The data is stored on Polybase database and NFT token gating is also done with it
- We also have easy onboarding methods for web2 users.
- We believe in providing this opportunity to all of the users irrespective of their knowledge in web3.

# Features
- Our platform leverages a cutting-edge Particle Network Authentication System, providing a seamless and secure onboarding process.
- The platform offers a robust bounty system powered by token gating powered by Polybase
- To ensure the quality and trustworthiness of submissions within the DAO bounty platform, we implement a robust verification system.
